# sockethub-schemas
Sockethub AS2.0 and other JSON schemas

## usage

```javascript
var SockethubSchemas = require('sockethub-schemas');
// SockethubSchemas.ActivityStream
// SockethubSchemas.ActivityObject
```

**note** under heavy development, not ready for use. The goal is to split out the schema definitions and generation from the core of sockethub to both simplify the core and make it easier to visualize the current validation schemas.
